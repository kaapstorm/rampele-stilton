Noah Rampele-Stilton
====================

This is the secret story of Noah Rampele-Stilton.

If you are reading this, it is because I have died, and this document
has been received by one of several newspapers and blogs to whom I have
bequeathed it.

My husband, a former president, has been dead for several years now. My
son has known the truth since his 16th birthday, and he will weather the
repercussions of what I am about to write, I am sure of it. He has
endured more than this. So it was only myself who stood between you and
the truth, and now I am no more.


How it began
------------

My father was a businessman, and a sports enthusiast. He loved soccer
and rugby the most. He grew up during Apartheid, and at great expense,
his parents sent him to a private boarding school. Over the holidays, he
played soccer with his friends at home, but during term he played rugby
with his friends at school.

When I was eighteen, my father had some business in England and
Scotland, and he had the chance to see South Africa play Scotland at
Murrayfield in Edinburgh. He found that his seat was immediately in
front of our own president, who was watching the game with an old friend
of his whom my father did not recognise, and they were flanked by two
bodyguards. My father was so impressed with himself that here he was,
sitting just in front of his president. He was racking his brain to
think of something to say to introduce himself. He was listening to
every word the president and his friend were saying to each other. They
were not discussing politics. They were talking about their old school
friends, and Facebook, and at some point the president mentioned that he
needed some kind of online persona that portrayed him in a good light to
his people. And that was the moment my father chose to open is eager,
boastful, lying mouth.

He said, "Excuse me, sirs, I could not help but overhear you talking
about online presence, and my daughter is at a prestigious IT college in
Johannesburg, and may be able to help you with that. She is at the top
of her class, and her lecturer tells me that she is a genius. (She has
also inherited her mother's beauty and charm.) I have been a keen
supporter of you, Mr President, throughout the Struggle and your career,
and it would be my greatest honour if I could give to you the services
of my daughter to build you your own, personal website and whatever
Internet work you need. She can do it all."

How my father's heart did not explode with happiness when he heard the
president's response, I don't know. The president replied, "She sounds
wonderful. I am very interested in your offer. Speak to one of my people
after the game, and we can arrange something."

I am not sure how much of the president's response owed to my father's
description of my skills, or the mention of my appearance. The truth was
that I was prettier than I was talented. That's not to say that I was
dumb. I worked hard, and I was doing well in college, but I was
certainly not a genius.

When my father told me his "wonderful news", I was terrified. "You'll be
fine, sweetie. I know how smart you are. You can make him a website."

"It's a little more complicated than that, Dad."

"You'll come up with something, Sweetie, I know you will."


The First Task
--------------

I had met my boyfriend at the time on a dating site, and there were a
couple of other guys I'd been chatting with. I'd kept up a conversation
with one of them out of pure curiosity. Nobody with a profile as lousy
as his could possibly be a liar or a cheat. He was into computers,
security, and backend development. His head looked like it was carpeted
in shaggy facial hair, with gaps for a pair of gentle eyes, and a big,
open grin. His username was "cheesygeek" (which he spelled
"ch33s33g33k"), but he said everyone called him "Anon" (because it
alludes to "anonymous" but it means "soon", he explained.)

I whatsapped him. I explained what my dad had done. He was, of course,
absolutely sweet about it all. He said I should tell him about any
developments. He'd go and look into reputation management software, and
he'd be happy to help me "throw something together".

Everything went quiet for a couple of months, and then suddenly it was
like everything was last minute. Isn't that how it always goes? I got a
call from "the president's office". A man explained to me that I would
be put up in a hotel from Friday evening to Sunday morning. By Sunday
morning I will have deployed a blog, and a backend management system
that lists all online reports about the president, and e-mails press
releases to media outlets about positive news about the president. And
there must be an authorisation system so the president can OK press
releases from his phone. They would e-mail me a spec, "just some
ideas", but I should "use my creativity" and "you know, make what a
president would need, and expect". Oh, and "excellence should be your
lodestar". "Lodestar"?! Clearly I hadn't got the memo on the new
officespeak.

I whatsapped Anon immediately. He asked which hotel. He asked me to
email him the spec. He said I should find out what handset the
president uses, and "please, God, tell me the president doesn't use IE".
He said he'd take care of the backend, and that the front-end design
would take the longest time (what?!) so I should get started on that
immediately. And he said I shouldn't worry. This would be a breeze. That
we can work on this together. That it will be fun. He said "I'll see you
Friday".

Friday morning, I whatsapped him again. "When are we meeting?" He just
replied, "busy cu later I'll find you"

I was collected in one of those standard government-issue black Mercedes
Benzes, and taken to a very nice hotel in the middle of the city. "Yes.
Miss Mamela Nwabisa. You are in 1105. We have ensured that you will not
be disturbed. None of the other rooms on the 11th floor will be occupied
this weekend."

I was shown to my suite. There were two rooms; a bedroom and a spacious
lounge. The couches had been removed, and a conference table placed in
the middle. There was a PC and a Mac on the table, "in case you didn't
bring your own computer," I was told. "Freshly installed," the concierge
added.

And then I was all alone.

I sat down at the table. I pulled out my beaten-up old laptop, and
opened the design work I'd prepared. Somehow, magically, it was all
going to be installed on top of a backend that Anon had built. Where was
he? How was he going to find me?

A knock came from the bedroom, and he walked into the lounge.

"Hey, dude, where the? Where did you come from?"

He grinned this big grin. "I have a friend. I was in the room next
door."

"They said the floor was empty."

"They make mistakes."

I smiled back at him. "Sweet! I'm so glad you're here. You have no
idea."

"You're going to be even more glad. I finally got everything working
this afternoon."

"Seriously? Don't joke with me."

"Totally. Took a couple of late nights, but mostly I just reused
existing libraries. I just need a decent skin. How's the design?"

"Well, I think I've got most of it done. We still need to cut it up for
the backend, cos I didn't know what you've done."

"Oh, that'll be OK. I'll help you. I'll go back next door. You order a
big pizza, and 2 litres of Coke, and we'll hammer this out."

"How do I thank you?"

"It's nothing."

"No. I can't accept all your time, and your work, and your kindness. It
makes me feel indebted, and I don't want to feel that way. Here." I took
off my necklace. It was a fine gold chain, with a green stone set in a
small pendant. Maybe an emerald, I didn't really know. I've never been
much for jewellery, but this had been a gift from my dad when I turned
16. "This was from my dad. You've got him out of just as much shit as
you've got me out of. It's the least he can do."

"Well, when you put it like that," said Anon. He wrapped it around his
wrist a few times. It wasn't too loose and it wasn't too tight. It
looked quite cool.

I ordered the food while he slipped next door, and we set to work. By 2
AM everything was done, and tested. By 4 AM it was deployed, and tested
and tested again.

I gave Anon a massive hug. He disappeared back where he came from, and I
slept until 8. Then I had a shower, went downstairs for breakfast, and
at 9 AM I demoed to the president.

I was ridiculously nervous, but he was really friendly, and made a
couple of lame jokes, and I laughed both from my nerves and from genuine
amusement. The demo went really well. I was part surprised, part wired,
part overjoyed. I pretended not to notice the way he leaned against me
when I showed him how to authorise press releases from his phone, and
held my arm when he congratulated me. He really was a charming man. And
when it was all over I was on such a high. I took myself out for lunch,
and phoned my dad, and told him how well it went.

Over the next week I went to some government office, showed some
administrators how it all worked, handed over the source code and the
passwords, walked away.


The Second Task
---------------

My dad called. The president had phoned him. Personally. The president
had said how amazingly impressed he was with my work. How this is going
to change the tide on his term in office. He had asked my dad if I could
make him another site. He said that to express his gratitude, he would
offer my dad the position of Minister of Sport (as if my dad made the
freaking website). Whatever income my dad was earning, the president was
sure that he could arrange for my dad's income to be doubled. Apparently
the current minister wasn't working out, was haemorrhaging his budget,
and "while a little bit of that is understandable, the government has
its limits, and it's just not looking good." Anyway, government wants
this country's own version of something called "change dot org", my dad
said. The president's office will be in touch.

My dad impressed upon me how important this is for him. "Don't screw
this up, Sweetie. This is the big one. It doesn't get bigger than this.
Whatever it takes, Sweetie, just do it. And if I can help in any way,
any way, just say so. Because, just imagine, Sweetie. A big house. Hell,
two big houses. Overseas holidays. We will be styling. Can you do it? Do
you know what 'change dot org' is?"

"Yes," I said, "it's a website where people create and support petitions
for political change. I'm sure I can come up with something."

"Sounds great. That is wonderful, Sweetie. You can make it happen. I
know you can."

"Thanks, Dad."

Holy shit! I needed Anon. I hated calling him like this -- just when I
have a crisis. We'd met up for coffee after he rescued my ass last time,
and we'd said we'd meet up again, but nothing happened after that.

I decided that if I get out of this one, I need to be a better friend.
And not just "Oh, we should totally do something some time." Before I
called him, I took out my phone, added a calendar reminder to "Phone
Anon" every Monday night, and added "Go do something with Anon" every
first Friday. That seemed reasonable. And if Fridays didn't work for
him, we could change it.

Then I dialled his number, and grovelled a little. I felt like last
time he had gone way above and beyond, and this request would require
even more work. But his response really took me by surprise: "Dude!" he
said, "Last time was awesome! I got to write a cool project with a
bunch of good friends online, and [cough] find my way into a hotel,
and, not to be too soppy or anything, spend a really exciting evening
working closely with an amazing woman."

The nerd flirt made me feel a little awkward, but also kinda warm
inside, and I was very relieved that his experience was positive, and
that it looked like he'd be willing to got through it again. Very
relieved. Also, awkward or not, he is lovely, and he made being a
prisoner in a hotel for a weekend more than bearable. He made it cool.

Because the project was more complex this time, we collaborated more on
how people would use the site, the details of what functionality the
site must offer, how the interface should work. This was not a weekend
kind of job. A site like this takes months. And I suspect the
president's office knew that, because they scheduled my weekend in the
hotel for four months time.

Anon and I worked solidly until then. We would meet at my flat first
thing in the morning, and I'd drive through to class during the day in
my little red Golf, and then I'd come straight back to work on the
site. He and some friends built the server environment to be able to
handle the load which the site would hopefully get. He and I worked on
the interface, breaking down the components of the workflow to make
sure users would never be waiting for the servers to update the
interface.

We built the system for nominating ideas for changes, and voting for
them. We developed the facility to establish and support a community of
users who would be able to moderate the site themselves. We built
reporting functionality for the government and for users. And we built
APIs so that other systems could integrate with ours.

At first Anon spent 10 hours a day at my place. Then 16. For the last
month he slept on my couch. We made a great team. We shared the
cooking. He was genial, and funny. He kept our work area clean. He
wasn't fastidious, but he was tidy. I liked having him around.

Finally it was time to go to the hotel for the weekend when I was
allegedly going to be doing all of the work, by myself.

It was the same routine as last time. Same floor, same suite, same
computers on the table. I never knew how he did it, but once again,
half an hour after I arrived, Anon entered from the bedroom.

We Monster-and-pizza-ed our way through the night, user-testing,
fixing, load-testing, fixing, checking documentation, editing, testing,
going through the presentation, testing, and more testing.

We stopped at around 5 AM. We decided we had done everything we could
do. We stepped away from our keyboards, he flopped onto the couch, and
I flopped down next to him. We were physically tired, but there was no
way we were going to be able to sleep.

"Thank you," I said.

"What?" he asked.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For everything. For the last four months. For everything you've done.
All the work. All the hours. Sleeping on my couch. This weekend.
Everything."

"Mela," he said, "I have never had this much fun ever. You are awesome.
I really," a barely noticeable pause, but I noticed it, "really like
you. It has been such a pleasure."

"It has. But I want you to have something."

"Why?"

"Because I owe you so much, and I don't want to feel that way. And I've
been thinking about this a lot. My dad is going to get a new job. And
he will be able to afford a lot of things we couldn't afford before.
But you've done all this and you're getting nothing for it. So ..."

"So?"

I was scratching in my bag.

"So here are my car keys. We can sort out the paperwork on Monday, but
here."

"What?!"

"Don't argue with me. Take my car. You have earned much more than this."

"How can I take your car?"

"My dad owes me a new one, at the very least. I should really be giving
you a new one. But this is what I've got right now, and I want, no, I
insist, that you take this one. I will not discuss this. It is yours
now. I'm going to Uber back to my place, so you can leave it in the
parking garage if you want. But it's yours now."

"Wow, Mela. Uh ... Wow. Thank you. I never expected this."

"Well let's hope the President doesn't get any more ideas, because I
have nothing else to give you." I grinned.

He grinned.

I knew what he was grinning about. Those eyes of his; part puppy, part
fox. I wondered whether he knew that my grin was the same grin.

We went quiet. We looked at the vase on the table. Maybe both of us
were thinking about each other's grins.

"I guess you should go back home in the morning," I said.

"I guess so," he responded.

The President loved the hand-over. I had breakfast at 8 AM, and went
through to the conference facilities at 9, where I presented the site
to him and two other ministers. The president and the ministers were
full of praise. Afterwards they shook my hand, by the president gave me
a hug. His cologne smelled of cinnamon and frankincense; venerable, and
familiar. He had a charisma about him. His approval and affection felt
like my reward, and won him my admiration.

The Office of the Presidency scheduled training, and I taught a team of
administrators how the site administration worked. The government
marketed it heavily, to much public praise. The demand jumped right up
on launch day. The servers scaled automatically, perfectly,
beautifully. The site remained responsive. The President phoned me to
thank me. My dad took me out for a slap-up meal. He was overjoyed. He
told me about his new job. His big office. His security detail. His
driver. His Merc. I asked for a new car. He didn't even blink. "Of
course, sweetie. I owe this all to you. What would you like?"

I got a Nissan Leaf -- a cute little electric hatch. I got it in green.
I thought that was appropriate. I stuck an Apple logo on the back
window. I loved my new car.

I took Anon out for dinner. He picked me up in my old Golf. There was
something comfortable and familiar about it. And comfortable and
familiar about Anon, too. Even though we had been chatting a lot over
WhatsApp, I missed having him around. My couch was cold since he left.


The Third Task
--------------

A couple of months later I got a call from a number that wasn't in my
contacts. I was making supper and my hands had mince on them. I let it
ring. The number called again. I watched my phone, wondering whether to
answer. I washed my hands, and my phone stopped ringing. Then the
number called again. I took the call. "Hello?"

"Miss Mamela Nwabisa?"

"Yes, speaking."

"Please hold for the president."

Shit. Now what?

"Hi, Mamela?" asked his familiar voice. Deep. Warm. A leather armchair
of a voice.

"Yes, Mr President."

"Please, Mamela, I feel we know each other well enough now for you to
call me Joshua."

"Uh, OK, uh, Joshua."

"That's much better." I could hear his smile. "Mamela," he continued,
"I called you personally, because I have a special project for you. You
have done such wonderful, and truly amazing work for us before. But
this project is different. And the incentive is personal.

"I believe there is a system called 'Ethereum' that can be used to
record assets and transactions. I know my government loses money in
procurement processes to bribery. And I know that we cannot ever
uncover all of it. But maybe this Ethereum system can close some gaps
in government procurement, and remove some of the opportunities for
corruption. Can you build a system that uses Ethereum for this? -- And
before you answer, Mamela, let me tell you what's on the line, for you,
personally.

"Mamela, you know in our culture that marriage is about more than love.
It is about deep, ancient, and wide relationships. Unlike in the West,
where people marry because of a fleeting feeling, in our culture a
woman becomes a part of her husband, and a man incorporates a wife into
who he is. Love does not start a marriage, and then die out, and then
the marriage ends in divorce. Rather, it is the marriage which starts a
deep and lifelong love. You are such a beautiful, and such an
intelligent woman. You make our nation proud. You have done so much for
this country already. If you can successfully complete this last
project, it would be an honour for me to incorporate you into who I am,
as my wife."

I was speechless.

It wasn't that I didn't have anything to say. I had so much to say. I
just didn't know how or where to start. Every little voice in my head
was shouting at once.

"I know this is a lot to take in," Joshua said. "I'm calling from my
personal number. Think it over. Call me any time. Any time at all. But
soon would be better because both of these issues, both you, and
corruption, are close to my heart, and I will be waiting to hear from
you."

"OK," was all I managed to say.

"OK, that's great. Have a good evening, Mamela."

"OK. Bye. Joshua."

"Goodbye."

Wow.

I phoned Anon. He loved the idea of an Ethereum-based procurement
system. He was silent on the idea of marrying the president.

I tried to sleep. I couldn't. I phoned Anon again. I asked him directly
about marrying the president. He was like, "Well, you'd have anything
you want ... but."

"But, what, Anon?"

"But I'll never be able to sleep on your couch again. I'll never make
you my spaghetti bolognese."

"OK, wait, maybe no to sleeping on the couch, but you can always make
me your spaghetti bolognese. If I'm the president's wife, then I can
appoint you as my official spaghetti bolognese chef."

"Yeah," he said, but it didn't sound like "yeah." It sounded like "Not
really." It sounded like "That's not the point, Mela. I don't want to
make you spaghetti bolognese. I want what we have. I want to sit on
the couch next to you. I want to feel your shoulder against mine. I
want to watch the way you slurp your noodles." But Anon didn't say that.

He thought about how this project would be the last project of its
kind. He thought this project would give him his last opportunities to
come over and eat spaghetti bolognese with me. Maybe he'd move back in
and sleep on the couch again. He didn't say any of that either. He just
said, "You should do it, Mela. Our country needs a system like this.
And being the president's wife, it's obviously the best thing for you,
right? You should say 'yes'."

After we hung up, I lay in bed, and I wondered whether Joshua was lying
in bed awake too. Whether he really was waiting for my call.

So I called him. And if he had been sleeping, it didn't sound like it.

"Mamela!" he answered.

"Hi, Joshua."

"Is it a 'yes'?"

"Yes, Joshua, it's a 'yes'."

"That is wonderful! I will have my office call you in the morning, and
they will arrange everything, as usual."

"Thank you."

"No, thank you, Mamela. This is the best news I have heard all month.
Now you sleep well."

"OK. Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

Anon arrived the next morning, in his red Golf, with his sleeping bag
and two bags of groceries. He made us coffee and scrambled some eggs.
He drove with me to class, and he was thinking out loud, "Ethereum is
so cool. Do you know how cool Ethereum is? It is super cool, Mela.
We're going to need an app for handheld devices to scan QR codes. Do
you think we'll need to support low-connectivity environments? Yes, I
think we'll have to. We'll have to record transactions on the device
when it's offline, and sync later. The device won't be able to store
the entire Ethereum blockchain, but we'll have to send it enough data
to process the asset's workflow. And the workflow itself will need to
be user-determined. We can build it with templates, like building
blocks, and provide a set, but allow it to be extended."

He kept talking all the way, bouncing ideas off me, exploring tangents.
I realised early on that this was going to be bigger than the last
project. Much bigger. This would take a small startup a year to get a
basic system. Anon couldn't do this with just a few friends. I told him
so.

"Oh, don't you worry. I have a lot of friends. And some people who owe
me big. Also, ours isn't the only country that needs this. Other
countries. International corporations. Because we're building this for
the government, I can't license the code, but if it's open source from
the beginning, I can sell consulting services on top of it. So that's a
services-based startup right there. I can sell that startup to a large
software corporation that's trying to do the same thing, like Microsoft
or IBM, so they get our expertise, and we can service their customer
base. That's an investment opportunity. I can find contractors who will
want a piece of that."

I told the Office of the Presidency that I'd only be able to do this in
nine month's time. I didn't think I could push it to a year. I said I'd
need to do a lot of research first, and of course I had my own studies,
and exams, etc. They agreed to the date.

In the meantime, Anon registered a company, built a team, and laid down
a framework. We quickly settled into our old work routine. I learned
about mobile interface design and development. Anon called in a favour
from a lawyer, issued private shares to developers, and some carefully
chosen and well-connected friends, and friends of friends. He hired a
small office. This wasn't like the other projects. This was a business.

But every evening Anon and I would come back to my place, and keep
working, breaking to have supper on the couch.

I liked this Anon. Previously Anon was sweet. Cute even. This Anon was
more enthusiastic, more confident, sexier.

The platform started to take shape. Asset ownership was working.
Templates and workflows were working. Off-line transactions were
working. On-line syncing was working. Client-side encryption was
working. Transaction spoof detection was working. Dashboards and
aggregated reports, done. APIs for monitoring workflows, and exporting
data, done. Two months before I was going to be spending an unnecessary
weekend in a hotel, Anon already had a few customers using the software
in pilot projects.

One evening, a few days before the hotel weekend, Anon had made his
signature spaghetti. I watched him watching me slurp a noodle. Then I
waited for him to take a forkful in his mouth, and I caught the other
end of a long noodle, and put it in my mouth.

A little cheesy, I know. Cheesier than the cheddar on the bolognese.
But he grinned like crazy. And my heart thumped heavily. And I slurped
all the way up to his mouth.

I hadn't thought this through. Slurping a noodle is completely
different from kissing. Kissing a mouthful of pasta is not sexy.

But he got the message. We chewed hurriedly, swallowed awkwardly, put
our bowls aside, and kissed. And kissed some more. And pulled off
clothing. And, well, Anon didn't sleep on the couch after that.

I had spent the build-up to the weekend in the hotel preparing the
presentation and training material.

By the time the weekend came, everything was done. There was nothing
left to do. Except one thing ... Anon's reward. I had gone shopping for
underwear. Several pairs, in different styles. And maybe I had
purchased a toy or two from adamandeve.com. I removed every undesirable
follicle from my body. I had a manipedi and I got my hair done. I hardly
ever wore make-up, and I didn't want the hotel staff to suspect
anything, so I just did my eyes myself.

The moment I arrived in the hotel suite, I ordered the seafood platter
from room service, a bottle of Champagne, and the black forest gatteau;
not a couple of slices, the whole thing.

When Anon let himself in from the bedroom, I was already in the silk
negligee. He stared at me, "What?"

"This is your reward this time: Me. I love you, Anon. I will always
love you. I will always keep you, here, in my heart. So I want you to
have me. Even if this is our last weekend, I want it to be the best
weekend of your entire life.

"Shall we start with the Champagne?"

"Fuck no! I'm going to start with you!" And in true, clumsy-cute
Anon-style romance, he fireman-lifted me over his shoulder, and charged
back into the bedroom he'd just emerged from, dumped me onto the bed,
and pulled off the panties I'd spent about an hour carefully selecting,
without even noticing how the lacework delicately elaborated on my
painstakingly preened lady parts.

"Nice lace," he whispered in my ear, as he struggled his way out of his
jeans.

Well, I thought, OK. I'm glad I'd spent that hour choosing them then.

I'll skip the details. I'll mention by Sunday morning the cake was
finished. The bed had chocolate icing and Champagne on it. There was
cheese and Peppadews from the pizza I had ordered at some point on
Saturday night smeared into the pile carpet. My body ached like an
athlete's, but not in the places most athletes ache. I was happier than
I'd ever been in my life. Anon was spent, many times over. And we had
had a damn good cry at some point, worked through the tears with
kisses, and then worked through the kisses with sex.

Sometimes the greatest moments in life are as great as they are because
you know they will end.

Like life. I don't believe in heaven any more. You live life more fully
when you know that it's all you're ever going to get.

Joshua clapped at several points through the presentation. The
ministers in attendance gave me a standing ovation.

At the end of it, in front of his ministers, he came forward, and put
out his hand as if to shake mine, and then dropped to his knee. He
pulled out a little box from his jacket pocket, and as he opened it to
reveal a large, shiny stone, mounted high on a silver ring, he asked,
"Will you do me the honour, Mamela Nwabisa, to accept my offer of a
lifetime of my love."

I smiled. And I cried, for Anon, for the choice I was making, for my
dad and the rest of my family, for my future. I'm sure Joshua thought I
was crying because that's what a girl might do when the president
proposes to her. I looked him in the eye, still smiling, and said,
"Yes."


Ben
---

When I realised I was pregnant, I thought I could hide the conception
date. I would have a discrete conversation with the gynae. But what
about my baby's skin colour? My new husband was not a dark man, but Anon
was coloured. It would be obvious that my baby is not my husband's. The
president, cuckolded. It would by shameful, disrespectful,
dishonourable. I was about to ruin my husband's career, my life, my
dad's life, everything.

I named my son Ben. Not Benjamin. Just Ben, after "ben oni", Hebrew for
"son of my sorrow".

The doctor said it would be OK. Race is a complicated thing, and it
might not be obvious at all.

When Ben was born, if it was obvious to my husband's colleagues and
friends, they hid it. There were no rumours in the papers or the
tabloids. The country was overjoyed. Ben was beautiful. And an instant
celebrity. The media loved him.

But my husband knew. "Who was he?" he whispered in my ear. "One of your
little computer nerd boyfriends? Is that it? Am I not clever enough for
you? Who did you fuck? Who was it?"

I knew Anon would want to see Ben. And I knew he could not. He would
die. My husband would find a way to have him killed. I tried to send him
a message. In a television interview, I managed to slip in "We want no
anonymous well-wishers." I paused, and explained with, "We have got
letters to the presidency from people we are unable to thank. We may not
have time to get back to everyone, but we would like to be able to."

I didn't know if he'd get the message. And even if he did, I didn't know
whether he'd understand it. It was a bit obscure. But it had to be. It
caused confusion in the press, and among the population, and I had to
come up with some lame explanation afterwards. It was a bit of a mess.

I missed Anon so badly. My son had his reckless grin. His kind,
generous, loving eyes. So badly. I missed him even more for knowing I
could never see him again.


Noah
----

Anon got my message. But the idiot (and I mean that in the kindest way)
completely misunderstood. He phoned me on my old phone, from a number I
didn't have in my contacts. Probably a sim card he bought on the
street. All he said was, "It's me". I was shopping. An agent was
nearby. I mumbled into the phone "I can't speak, we can't, you must
never call me, hide," I whispered "I love you," and I hung up. I
glanced at the agent, but he wasn't looking at me. I thought he must
have missed it.

But he didn't.

Throw-away phones mean nothing. You can still trace a call to a cell
tower. You have street cameras. You have staff. You have the resources
of the entire government.

One day I was watching TV with my husband. Out of the blue, he said,
"He's dead."

"Who is dead, Baby?" I asked, thinking he was talking about the show we
were watching.

"Noah."

"Who's Noah?" Now I was confused. There wasn't anyone called Noah in the
episode.

"Don't play stupid with me. Your nerd boyfriend. Noah."

"Baby, honestly, I don't know anyone called Noah."

"Oh. He called himself Anon or something. But his name was Noah
Rampele-Stilton. Took fucking ages to find the little fucker. Slippery
little shit that one. Cost a fucking fortune. You know those helicopters
we bought a few months ago? That was an I'll-scratch-your-back to the
Americans, in exchange for a little intelligence. VPNs are not private
-- remember that, Baby. And cellphones -- there's no such thing as an
anonymous phone call."

But I wasn't listening. I couldn't hear him explaining, "I had no
choice, Mamela. You know he could have filed for paternity. You know he
could have taken your first-born." I wasn't listening and I couldn't
argue. Tears were silently slicing down my cheeks. I did not want to be
next to him, but I couldn't leave. I waited until the show was
finished, and then took a shower. I sat on the shower floor, and let
the hot water burn away my sobs.

Anon: Almost an anagram of Noah. And Rampele-Stilton: The cheese in
ch33s33g33k. I had finally caught his joke, after his death.

I loved you for the rest of my life, Anon. I have poured my love for you
into our son, who you never got to meet.

Those who are remembered never truly die. I have released this document
so that all may know the real story of Noah Rampele-Stilton, whose name
he kept a secret. Now we will remember him for the amazing man, and the
unknown hero, and the object of my love, that he really was.
