Noah Rampele-Stilton
====================

This is the secret story of Noah Rampele-Stilton.

If you are reading this, it is because I have died, and this document has been received by one of several newspapers and blogs to whom I have bequeathed it.

My husband, a former president, has been dead for several years now. My son has known the truth since his 16th birthday, and he will weather the repercussions of what I am about to write, I am sure of it. He has endured more than this. So it was only myself who stood between you and the truth, and now I am no more.

How it began
------------

My father was a businessman, and a sports enthusiast. He loved soccer and rugby the most. He grew up during Apartheid, and at great expense his parents sent him to a private boarding school. Over the holidays, he played soccer with his friends at home, but during term he played rugby with his friends at school.

When I was eighteen, my father had some business in England and Scotland, and he had the chance to see South Africa play Scotland at Murraysfield in Edinburgh. He found that his seat was immediately in front of our own president, who was watching the game with an old friend of his whom my father did not recognise, and they were flanked by two bodyguards, or intelligence agents. My father was so impressed with himself that here he was, sitting just in front of his president. He was wracking his brain to think of something to say to introduce himself. He was listening to every word the president and his friend were saying to each other. There were not discussing politics. They were talking about their old school friends, and Facebook, and at some point the president mentioned that he needed some kind of online persona that portrayed him in a good light to his people. And that was the moment my father chose to open is eager, boastful, lying mouth.

He said, "Excuse me, sirs, I could not help but overhear you talking about online presence, and my daughter is at a presigious IT college in Johannesburg, and may be able to help you with that. She is at the top of her class, and her lecturer tells me that she is a genius. (She has also inherited her mother's beauty and charm.) I have been a keen supporter of you, Mr President, throughout the Struggle and your career, and it would be my greatest honour if I could give to you the services of my daughter to build you your own, personal website and whatever Internet work you need. She can do it all."

How my father's heart did not explode with happiness when he heard the president's response, I don't know. The president replied, "She sounds wonderful. I am very interested in your offer. Speak to one of my people after the game, and we can arrange something."

I am not sure how much of the president's response owed to my father's description of my skills, or the mention of my appearance. The truth was that I was prettier than I was talented. That's not to say that I was dumb. I worked hard, and I was doing well in college, but I was certainly not a genius.

When my father told me his "wonderful news", I was terrified. "You'll be fine, sweetie. I know how smart you are. You can make him a website."

"It's a little more complicated than that, Dad."

"You'll come up with something, Sweetie, I know you will."

The First Task
--------------

I had met my boyfriend at the time on a dating site, and there were a couple of other guys I'd been chatting with. I'd kept up a conversation with one of them out of pure curiosity. Nobody with a profile as lousy as his could possibly be a liar or a cheat. He was into computers, security, and backend development. His head looked like it was carpeted in shaggy facial hair, with gaps for a pair of gentle eyes, and a big, open grin. His username was "cheesygeek" (which he spelled "ch33s33g33k"), but he said everyone called him "Anon" (Because it alludes to "anonymous" but it means "soon", he explained.)

I whatsapped him. I explained what my dad had done. He was, of course, absolutely sweet about it all. He said I should tell him about any developments. He'd go and look into reputation management software, and he'd be happy to help me "throw something together".

Everything went quiet for a couple of months, and then suddenly it was like everything was last minute. Isn't that how it always goes?

I got a call from "the president's office". A man explained to me that I would be put up in a hotel from Friday evening to Sunday morning. By Sunday morning I will have deployed a blog, and a backend management system that lists all online reports about the president, and e-mails press releases to media outlets about positive news about the president. And there must be an authorisation system so the president can OK press releases from his phone. They would e-mail me a spec, "just some ideas", but I should "use my creativity" and "you know, make what a president would need, and expect". Oh, and "excellence should be your lodestar". "Lodestar"?! Clearly I hadn't got the memo on the new officespeak.

I whatsapped Anon immediately. He asked which hotel. He asked me to e-mail him the spec. He said I should find out what handset the president uses, and "please, God, tell me the president doesn't use IE". He said he'd take care of the backend, and that the front-end design would take the longest time (what?!) so I should get started on that imediately. And he said I shouldn't worry. This would be a breeze. That we can work on this together. That it will be fun. He said "I'll see you Friday".

Friday morning, I whatsapp him again. "When are we meeting?" He just replied, "Busy. See you later. I'll find you."

I was collected in one of those standard government-issue black Mercedes Benzes, you know the ones that cost more than an entire township of houses, and taken to a very nice hotel in the middle of the city. "Yes. Miss Mamela Nwabisa. You are in 1105. We have ensured that you will not be disturbed. None of the other rooms on the 11th floor will be occupied this weekend."

I was shown to my suite. There were two rooms; a bedroom and a spacious lounge. The couches had been removed, and a conference table placed in the middle. There was a PC and a Mac on the table, "in case you didn't bring your own computer," I was told. "Freshly installed," the concierge added.

And then I was all alone.

I sat down at the table. I pulled out my beaten-up old laptop, and opened the design work I'd prepared. Somehow, magically, it was all going to be installed on top of a backend that Anon had built. Where was he? How was he going to find me?

A knock came from the bedroom, and he walked into the lounge.

"Hey, dude, where the? Where did you come from?"

He grinned this big grin. "I have a friend. I was in the room nextdoor."

"They said the floor was empty."

"They make mistakes."

I smiled back at him. "Sweet! I'm so glad you're here. You have no idea."

"You're going to be even more glad. I finally got everything working this afternoon."

"Seriously? Don't joke with me."

"Totally. Took a couple of late nights, but mostly I just reused existing libraries. I just need a decent skin. How's the design?"

"Well, I think I've got most of it done. We still need to cut it up for the backend, cos I didn't know what you've done."

"Oh, that'll be OK. I'll help you. I'll go back nextdoor. You order a big pizza, and 2 litres of Coke, and we'll hammer this out."

"How do I thank you?"

"It's nothing."

"No. I can't accept all your time, and your work, and your kindness. It makes me feel indebted, and I don't want to feel that way. Here." I took off my necklace. It was a fine gold chain, with a green stone set in a small pendant. Maybe an emerald, I didn't really know. I've never been much for jewellery, but this had been a gift from my dad when I turned 16. "This was from my dad. You've got him out of just as much shit as you've got me out of. It's the least he can do."

"Well, when you put it like that," said Anon. He wrapped it around his wrist a few times. It wasn't too loose and it wasn't too tight. It looked quite cool.

I ordered the food while he slipped nextdoor, and we set to work. By 2 AM everything was done, and tested. By 4 AM it was deployed, and tested and tested again.

I gave Anon a massive hug. He disappeared back where he came from, and I slept until 9. Then I had a shower, went downstairs for breakfast, and at 10 AM I demoed to the president.

I was ridiculously nervous, but he was really friendly, and made a couple of lame jokes, and I laughed both from my nerves and from genuine amusement. The demo went really well. I was part surprised, part wired, part overjoyed. I pretended not to notice the way he leaned against me when I showed him how to authorise press releases from his phone, and held my arm when he congratulated me. He really was a charming man. And when it was all over I was on such a high. I took myself out for lunch, and phoned my dad, and told him how well it went.

Over the next week I went to some government office, showed some
administrators how it all worked, handed over the source code and the
passwords, walked away.

The Second Task
---------------

My dad called. The president had phoned him. Personally. The president had said how amazingly impressed he was with my work. How this is going to change the tide on his term in office. He had asked my dad if I could make him another site. He said that to express his gratitude, he would offer my dad the position of Minister of Sport (as if my dad made the freaking website). Whatever my dad was making, the president was sure he could arrange his income to double. Apparently the current minister wasn't working out, was haemorrhaging his budget, and "while a little bit of that is understandable, the government has its limits, and it's just not looking good." Anyway, government wants this country's own version of something called "change dot org", my dad said. The president's office will be in touch.

My dad impressed upon me how important this is for him. "Don't screw this up, Sweetie. This is the big one. It doesn't get bigger than this. Whatever it takes, Sweetie, just do it. And if I can help in any way, any way, just say so. Because, just imagine, Sweetie. A big house. Hell, two big houses. Overseas holidays. We will be styling. Can you do it? Do you know what 'change dot org' is?"

"Yes," I said, "it's a website where people create and support petitions for political change. I'm sure I can come up with something."

"Sounds great. That is wonderful, Sweetie. You can make it happen. I know you can."

"Thanks, Dad."

Holy shit! I needed Anon. I hated calling him like this -- just when I have a crisis. We'd met up for coffee after he rescued my ass last time, and we'd said we'd meet up again, but nothing happened after that.





The Third Task
--------------



I wanted Anon to have me. It was not payment. For him, it was a gift. But for me, it was a surrender.

I thought I understood the stakes.

I had no idea.

Ben
---

When I realised I was pregnant, I thought I could hide the conception date. I would have a discrete conversation with the gynae. But what about my baby's skin colour? My new husband was not a dark man, but Anon was coloured. It would be obvious that my baby is not my husband's. The president, cuckolded. It would by shameful, disrespectful, dishonourable. I was about to ruin my husband's career, my life, my dad's life, everything.

I named my son Ben. Not Benjamin. Just Ben, after "Ben oni", Hebrew for "son of my sorrow".

The doctor said it would be OK. Race is a complicated thing, and it might not be obvious at all.

When Ben was born, if it was obvious to my husband's colleagues and friends, they hid it. There were no rumours in the papers or the tabloids. The country was overjoyed. Ben was beautiful. And an instant celebrity. The media loved him.

But my husband knew. "Who was he?" he whispered in my ear. "One of your little computer nerd boyfriends? Is that it? Am I not clever enough for you? Who did you fuck? Who was it?"

I knew Anon would want to see Ben. And I knew he could not. He would die. My husband would find a way to have him killed. I tried to send him a message. In a television interview, I managed to slip in "We want no anonymous well-wishers." I paused, and explained with, "We have got letters to the presidency from people we are unable to thank. We may not have time to get back to everyone, but we would like to be able to."

I didn't know if he'd get the message. And even if he did, I didn't know whether he'd understand it. It was a bit obscure. But it had to be.

I missed him so badly. My son had his reckless grin. His kind, generous, loving eyes. I missed him so badly. I missed him even more for knowing I could never see him again.

Noah
----

Anon got my message. But the idiot (and I mean that in the kindest way) completely misunderstood. He thought I wanted to hear from him. He phoned me on my old phone, from a number I didn't have in my contacts. Probably a sim card he bought on the street. All he said was, "It's me". I was shopping. An agent was nearby. I mumbled into the phone "I can't speak, we can't, you must never call me, hide, I love you," and I hung up. I glanced at the agent, but he wasn't looking at me. I thought he must have missed it.

But he didn't.

Throw-away phones mean nothing. You can still trace a call to a cell tower. You have street cameras. You have staff. You have the resources of the entire government.

One day I was watching TV with my husband. Out of the blue, he said, "He's dead."

"Who is dead, Baby?" I asked, thinking he was talking about the show we were watching.

"Noah."

"Who's Noah?" Now I was confused. There wasn't anyone called Noah in the episode.

"Don't play stupid with me. Your nerd boyfriend. Noah."

"Baby, honestly, I don't know anyone called Noah."

"Oh. He called himself Anon or something. But his name was Noah Rampele-Stilton. Took fucking ages to find the little fucker. Slippery little shit that one. Cost a fucking fortune. You know those helicopters we bought a few months ago? That was an I'll-scratch-your-back to the Americans, in exchange for a little intelligence. VPNs are not private -- remember that, Baby. And cellphones -- there's no such thing as an anonymous phone call."

But I wasn't listening. I couldn't hear him any more. Tears were silently slicing down my cheeks. I did not want to be next to him, but I couldn't leave. I waited until the show was finished, and then took a shower. I sat on the shower floor, and let the hot water burn away my sobs.

Anon: Almost an anagram of Noah. And Rampele-Stilton: The cheese in ch33s33g33k. I had finally caught his joke, after his death.

I loved you for the rest of my life, Anon. I have poured my love for you into our son. I mixed it with my love for him. I imagined that if I mix the love for two people together, and give it all to him, then he would get some of the love that you were never able to give him.
